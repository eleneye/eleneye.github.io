                        <p> However, rather than some asteroid that will orbit around the Earth, it may actually just be some old space junk that made its way back to our planet.
                            Dr. Paul Chodas, the director of NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies, believes that the object, named Asteroid 2020 SO, is an old booster rocket from the 1960s.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>"I suspect this newly discovered object 2020 SO to be an old rocket booster because it is following an orbit about the Sun that is extremely similar to Earth's, nearly circular, in the same plane, and only slightly farther away the Sun at its farthest point," Chodas told CNN.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>"That's precisely the kind of orbit that a rocket stage separated from a lunar mission would follow, once it passes by the Moon and escapes into orbit about the Sun. It's unlikely that an asteroid could have evolved into an orbit like this, but not impossible."
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Chodas analyzed the motion of the asteroid backwards in time to try and link it with any known lunar mission launch and found that it was likely in the "vicinity of the Earth back in late 1966."</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            He said that correlates with the launch of Surveyor 2 on September 20, 1966. That mission was designed to have a soft landing on the Moon, but a failure led to the spacecraft crashing, Chodas said. The Centaur rocket that was used to boost the spacecraft passed by the Moon and went into orbit near the Sun and has not been seen again, until now, Chodas suspects.</p>

                        <p> The asteroid strike that doomed the dinosaurs is an event that many people are aware of. It wiped out more than three-quarters of all life on Earth 66 million years ago.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            But it was only one of the Big Five mass extinctions the planet has experienced since living organisms evolved 3.5 billion years ago, and wasn't the worst.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Now, scientists say they have identified evidence of a new mass extinction event in the fossil record, and it's one that allowed dinosaurs to dominate the Earth for more than 200 million years.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            It took place 232 million to 234 million years ago and has been called the Carnian Pluvial Episode.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            "So far, palaeontologists had identified five 'big' mass extinctions in the past 500 million years of the history of life," said study co-author Jacopo Dal Corso, a geologist at China University of Geosciences at Wuhan, in a news statement.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            "Each of these had a profound effect on the evolution of the Earth and of life. We have identified another great extinction event, and it evidently had a major role in helping to reset life on land and in the oceans, marking the origins of modern ecosystems."

                    <section>
                        <p> A California city announced a $4 million settlement of a federal lawsuit with the family of Miles Hall, a 23-year-old Black man who was shot by police last year while having a mental health episode.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            "The events of the day were tragic and difficult for all involved -- the Hall family, the Walnut Creek community, and the police officers called to the scene," the city of Walnut Creek said in a Friday news release. "While the City recognizes the continuing loss for the Hall family, it is the City's sincere hope that settlement of this civil lawsuit will provide a step towards healing."
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>A long court battle, the city's attorney Noah Blechman said in the release, "is not in the best interest of anyone involved."
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The settlement, Hall's mother says, does not mean justice for her son. But it means the family can move on from legal proceedings and focus on the work they've started through the Miles Hall Foundation, pushing for a reformed response to mental health emergencies.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            "Money is not going to give us peace, it's not going to give us satisfaction," Taun Hall said. "Justice will be when we are able to have a non-police response for the mentally ill, at least here to start in Contra Costa County. And then, it could be something... throughout the nation."</p>
